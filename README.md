# Servlet CRUD üßë‚Äçüíª‚úÖ
This project demonstrates the use of Java Servlets for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations within a web application. <br>
The project consists of a web application that allows users to manage a list of items. The application has a user interface for displaying the list of items, and for adding, modifying, and deleting items from the list. The back-end of the application uses Java Servlets to handle the CRUD operations, and an in-memory data store to store the list of items. The project also includes unit tests written in JUnit to ensure the application's functionality.
